# Generic Implementation of Data Structure
This project provides a collection of commonly used data structures implemented in Java with generic types. This allows the data structures to be reusable and type-safe, enabling them to handle various data types such as integers, strings, or custom objects.

# Features
Generic Implementation: All data structures are implemented using Java generics, ensuring type safety and flexibility.
# Common Data Structures:
Stack
Queue
Linked List (Singly and Doubly)
Custom Methods: Each data structure comes with standard operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal, along with additional utility methods.
